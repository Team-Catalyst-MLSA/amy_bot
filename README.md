- **Escalation to Mail Sometimes, Student Ambassadors may need to contact the SA-Coordinator or the SA-Help team for more specific or urgent issues. Amy can facilitate this by sending an email to the appropriate recipient on behalf of the user. She can also ask for the userâ€™s consent and confirmation before sending the email**

- **Escalation within Teams Another way to escalate an issue is to use the Teams channel, where Student Ambassadors can interact with each other and the program team. Amy can directly message your issue to the SA Coordinator or SA Help within Teams. She will ask for the userâ€™s consent and confirmation before sendingÂ theÂ message**
